<h1 align="center">Guess The Word Game (Art Edu Edition)</h1>

Inspired by the game of Hangman, a great classic among children's group games. 

This version of the game focuses on the topic of art. Each word or group of words answers the question "what does an art degree bring you?". The answers, and the hints attached to them, are deliberately ironic and are intended to make the player aware of the difficulties faced by emerging artists who have recently graduated.

## Why focus on art?

Being an artist myself, I am aware of the problems in the field. Artistic and cultural work, significantly more than other professions, is characterised by intermittency, heterogeneity and instability. Moreover, it is often not fairly remunerated or sufficiently protected like other sectors.
Artists often live in existential uncertainty and only established artists can afford to live entirely from their income as an artist. 

## On the use of irony

Irony is a specific type of humour that provides a useful tool for understanding and communicating a problematic situation. It is also through irony that creative and alternative solutions can be created.
Irony can function as a tool for sense-making, and as a way of handling multiple and contradictory realities. The critique proposed through irony can even destabilize the hegemonic, or taken-for-granted, reality in the context in which it is used, leaving it open to question and suggesting an alternative reality.
